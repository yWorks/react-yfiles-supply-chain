# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

For using the component, [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) is required. You can evaluate yFiles for 60 days free of charge on [my.yworks.com](https://my.yworks.com/signup?product=YFILES_HTML_EVAL). See [Licensing](licensing) for more information on this topic.

## Project setup

1. **Installation:**
   Install the component via npm by running the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install @yworks/react-yfiles-supply-chain
   ```

   The supply-chain module has some peer dependencies that must be installed somewhere in your project. Since it is a React module, `react` and `react-dom` dependencies are needed.

   Additionally, the component relies on the [yFiles](https://www.yworks.com/yfiles-overview) library which is not published to the public npm registry. You can learn  how to work with the yFiles npm module in our [Developer's Guide](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/yfiles_npm_module).

   Ensure that the dependencies in the `package.json` file resemble the following:
   ```json
   {
     ...
     "dependencies": {
       "@yworks/react-yfiles-supply-chain": "^1.0.0",
       "react": "^18.2.0",
       "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
       "yfiles": "<yFiles package path>/lib/yfiles-26.0.0.tgz",
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

2. **License:**
   Be sure to invoke the <TypeLink type="registerLicense" /> function to activate the license for the application before using the company-ownership component.

3. **Usage:**
   Utilize the component in your application. Make sure to import the CSS stylesheet.

   ```tsx
   import {
     UserSupplyChainItem,
     UserSupplyChainConnection,
     registerLicense,
     SupplyChain,
     SupplyChainData
   } from '@yworks/react-yfiles-supply-chain'
   import '@yworks/react-yfiles-supply-chain/dist/index.css'
   import yFilesLicense from './license.json'

   function App() {
    registerLicense(yFilesLicense)

    const data = {
      items: [
        { name: 'Copper-Ore', id: 1, parentId: 3 },
        { name: 'Copper-Plate', id: 2, parentId: 4 },
        { name: 'Resource', id: 3 },
        { name: 'Material', id: 4 }
      ],
      connections: [{ sourceId: 1, targetId: 2 }]
    } satisfies SupplyChainData<UserSupplyChainItem, UserSupplyChainConnection>
    
    return  <SupplyChain data={data}></SupplyChain>
   }

   export default App
   ```

   > **Note:** By default, the <TypeLink type="SupplyChain" /> component adjusts its size to match the size of its parent element. Therefore, it is necessary to set the dimensions of the containing element or apply styling directly to the `SupplyChain` component. This can be achieved by defining a CSS class or applying inline styles.
